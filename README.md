# The Times Component Library

### Purpose

Home of The Times' `react`/`react native` components, using
 [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) to share across platforms

### Dev Environment

It's been developed almost solely on MacOS so there may be issues elsewhere

## Getting Started

```sh
# this will install the modules for the react storybooks and each components' dependencies too
yarn

# this will use webpack to build the storybook and run it in the browser for you to...browse
npm run storybook 
```
